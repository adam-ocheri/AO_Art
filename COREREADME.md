# Adam Ocheri Tech Art - base readme

This project is a Portfolio website, using a React app.
It is meant to showcase my 3 main skills: Programming, 3D Art, and Music production.
For most of the styling, the project uses a custom `css` library (simple css files I created and conventionalized), under the `./src/css` directory.
