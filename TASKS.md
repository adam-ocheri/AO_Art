# Adam Ocheri Tech Art - Tasks

# Task `1` | Status: `Completed` | Description: `Make the 'Docs' button in the RealtimeComposerTitle.tsx file navigate to route '/plugins/realtime-composer/docs' on click`

# Task `2` | Status: `Pending` | Description: `Make the RealtimeComposerDocs.tsx feel like an actual classic documentation page; it should have a 'fixed' or 'absolute' positioned side div 20% of the screen with all the entries for the documentation (like 'Getting Started', 'Music State Collections', 'Audio Channel Mixing', 'Debug Console'), and clicking on them would navigate in the page (another seperate div 80% width of the screen, scrollable)`

# Task `3` | Status: `Pending` | Description: `Replace the hyperlink that the 'RealtimeComposer' plugin link navigates to (currently it navigates to the video of Regime Change game) to '/plugins/realtime-composer'`

# Task `4` | Status: `Pending` | Description: `Create a nice way to display the functions of the realtime composer API reference:

A. Create a BP function template component that looks like a BP function, with inputs displaying on the side, and outputs on the right
A.1: The function name should be at the top of the component, with a white text color and deep-blue background on it - and then below that the in execution pin and the out execution pin, then below that the parameter inputs/outputs (this entire description is just a description of how a BP function node appears visually in unreal engine - make the best of it with what you know)
A.2: all inputs and outputs are displayed as a text name next to a small in or out ball, the ball colored as the data type of the parameter
A.3: an input looks like a ball on the left, then text to the right of it, i.e '@ ParameterName'
A.4: an output looks like a ball on the right, then text to the left of it, i.e 'ParameterName @'
B. Start arranging the functions as they appear on the example header file
